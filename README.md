# Wrapper Methods for feature selection 
BAIM MOHAMED JALAL, 
***
- The goal of feature selection is to choose a subset of the most relevant and informative features from a larger set of available features to improve the performance of a machine learning model or to reduce the computational complexity of the analysis.
- In this endeavor, we will employ three feature selection techniques:
  - Forward Selection
  - Backward Elimination
  - Recursive Feature Elimination.
